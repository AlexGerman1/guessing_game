# guessing

I created a game where you are given a piece of information, being how many states in the country I have visited, and you need to guess the right number. It has different ranges depending on how close / far you are and will give different messages depending on which range you guess in.

Then Stuart added a section to see the user and I had at least lived in the same amount of states. Based on their response a different set of answers were given.
